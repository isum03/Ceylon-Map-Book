                        Adam's Peak, also known as Sri Pada and Samanala Kanda in the local language, is a revered mountain in the central province of Sri Lanka, with an elevation of 2243 meters (7359 feet). At its summit lies a footprint that holds religious significance for multiple faiths. Buddhists regard it as the footprint of Lord Buddha, while Hindus associate it with Hanuman or Shiva, and Islamic and Christian traditions link it to Adam or St. Thomas. This site is revered by adherents of all religions in Sri Lanka.
                        <br><br>
                        Access to the mountain is facilitated by six trails: Ratnapura-Palabaddala, Hatton-Nallathanni, Kuruwita-Erathna, Murraywatte, Mookuwatte, and Malimboda. The mountain straddles the border of the Ratnapura and Nuwara Eliya districts. The period from December to March is particularly popular for ascending Adam's Peak.
