                        Adam's Peak, also known as Sri Pada and Samanala Kanda in the local language, is a revered mountain in the central province of Sri Lanka, with an elevation of 2243 meters (7359 feet). At its summit lies a footprint that holds religious significance for multiple faiths. Buddhists regard it as the footprint of Lord Buddha, while Hindus associate it with Hanuman or Shiva, and Islamic and Christian traditions link it to Adam or St. Thomas. This site is revered by adherents of all religions in Sri Lanka.
                        <br><br>
                        Access to the mountain is facilitated by six trails: Ratnapura-Palabaddala, Hatton-Nallathanni, Kuruwita-Erathna, Murraywatte, Mookuwatte, and Malimboda. The mountain straddles the border of the Ratnapura and Nuwara Eliya districts. The period from December to March is particularly popular for ascending Adam's Peak.

                        Adisham bungalow is situated in Badulla district. The Adisham Bungalow was once the country house of Sir Thomas Lester Villiers, but today it houses the Adisham Monastery of the St. Benedict. Constructed in 1931. Adisham Bungalow is perched on the edge of a cliff which is flanked by a larger outcrop fringed with tall pine trees, which somehow dwarf the house. The country home also has a wonderful view of the Uva valley, as well as a beautiful garden and orchard that you can stroll through. Access to the whole house is limited and visitors are only allowed to see the library and living room, but there is an adjoining guest house where people are more than welcomed to stay.
