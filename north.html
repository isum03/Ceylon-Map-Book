                        Elephant Pass, located in Northern Sri Lanka, holds historical, geographical, and strategic significance. <br>

Elephant Pass is a narrow strip of land that connects the Jaffna Peninsula to the rest of Sri Lanka, spanning across a lagoon known as Jaffna Lagoon. Historically, it has been a crucial route for both trade and military movements, owing to its strategic location between the Jaffna Peninsula and the mainland.
<br>
During the decades-long conflict in Sri Lanka, Elephant Pass gained further significance as a military stronghold and a site of numerous battles. The narrow causeway and the bridge over the lagoon were often contested, making it a focal point of military operations.
